### Submit Bug Reports or Feature requests

To request report bugs or suggest new features please create a new issue on [Tripal's GitHub Issue Queue](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/issues). Alternatively, you can reach out to us on Slack if you want to gauge community interest or if you are more comfortable with the casual environment.

### Ask Questions

You can ask questions or request support on [Our GitHub Discussion Channels](https://github.com/tripal/tripal/discussions) or in Slack. We do recomment more involved requests are made through GitHub discussions to ensure easier follow-up and help as many people as possible. Slack is ideal for short confirmation questions.
