Tripal is a toolkit for construction of online biological (genetics, genomics, breeding, etc), community database, and is a member of the GMOD family of tools. Tripal provides by default integration with the GMOD Chado database schema and Drupal, a popular Content Management Systems (CMS). Tripal is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 2.

Genomics, genetics, breeding and other biological data are increasingly complicated and time consuming to publish online for other researchers to search, browse and make discoveries.   Tripal provides a framework to reduce the complexity of creating such a site, and provides access to a community of similar groups that share community-standards, and interact to address questions and learn best practices for sharing, storing and visualizing complex biological data.
